# data_structures

As the speed and power of computers increases, so does the need for effective programming and algorithm analysis. By approaching these skills in tandem, we learn to develop well-constructed, maximally efficient programs using the C++ programming language.

In this repository I try to list as many programs that deal with topics from binary heaps to sorting to NP-completeness, as well as other advanced data structures and their implementation.
